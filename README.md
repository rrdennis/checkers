# Checkers
_An MVC Checkers application, written to be enjoyed in accordance with the traditional rules of English Draughts._

This means you and your opponent will be allowed twelve (12) men each, and thirty-two (32) squares upon which to move them.

_"Why are there no women in this game?"_

This is likely because this variant of the game was developed in the 16th century, when society was generally considerably more male-dominated than it is, even, say, now.

_"How do I play?"_

Men may advance one row at a time in diagonal fashion. Should either square in this next row be occupied by the enemy, the man must jump, capture the opposing man, and advance to the next square in that diagonal direction. From here, any additional possible jumps in either diagonal direction are also deemed compulsory.

If a player's man should reach the crownhead—the row of squares directly in front of the opposing player—this man will be made a king, and given powers worthy of his newfound regency.

If a player captures the entirety of his opponent's men, he or she wins the game. If the entirety of the remaining men are unable to move, the game ends in a draw.

_"One or two squares at a time? Forced captures? This sounds simple."_

Although the oldest possible ancestor of checkers was played over 5,000 years ago, this 8×8 variant of draughts wasn't solved until 2007, by the team of Canadian computer scientist Jonathan Schaeffer. From the standard starting position, both players can guarantee a draw with perfect play.


Pip pip!
